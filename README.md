# Hi, I'm Amin Ghadersohi 👋

## About Me
Engineering leader specializing in **data platforms**, **analytics infrastructure**, and **AI-native applications**.

I build the systems that help companies make better decisions with data—from mobile instrumentation processing billions of events to LLM-powered visualization tools.

## 🔭 What I'm Working On
- Leading **platform engineering** at [Preset](https://preset.io) for Apache Superset—scalability, reliability, and AI integration
- Building production **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** integrations for natural language data visualization
- Architecting AI testing frameworks and observability infrastructure for enterprise data platforms
- Advising startups on analytics infrastructure and engineering org design

## 💼 Background
- **Current:** Staff Software Engineer at [Preset](https://preset.io) (Platform & AI Integration)
- **Previously:** Engineering Leader at **Tinder** (10x engineer → 10x manager: built Hubble/EventsSDK analytics platform, scaled team 7→25 engineers)
- **Before that:** Senior Engineer at **Uber** (built Piper workflow platform, one of first mobile engineers on Rider Growth)
- **Also:** CTO & Cofounder at **Alvear Lending** (fintech platform)
- **Roots:** Architected [XDMoD](https://github.com/ubccr/xdmod), an NSF-funded open-source HPC analytics platform still operating at national labs 14+ years later
